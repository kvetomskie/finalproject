Now that you have postfix and sendemail configured and running, 
It's time to send the actual email.

This is done with the following command

$ sendemail -f <fromaddress> -t <destinationaddress> -u "<subject>" -m "<message>" -a <filepath for attaching files>

This will deliver an email with whatever from address you choose to your target.
This method will also send it to the spam folder and it will not download embedded images until out of the spam folder.

The next step will show you what we did to format it with HTML code and embed the image at the footer along with inserting a link.
