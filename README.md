# finalproject

This is the readme for the final capstone project with my partner Zane.
The goal of this project is to spoof an email using SMTP 
We are crafting a spear fishing email to make it look as legitimate as possible 
by including a real sender address, proper HTML formatting, an embedded image and a clickable link
with a malicious payload that executes a reverse shell.  
For obvious reasons we won't be including the information about crafting a payload and deploying the reverse shell.

The final product will be an email targeting Zane, a student at fullstack, to click a malicious link sent
by our instructor from his fullstack email address.
