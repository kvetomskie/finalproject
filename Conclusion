In the previous files we showed you how simple it is to set up your own SMTP server and 
send a spear fishing email to your target by spoofing the sender address, adding some HTML code
to make it look official and how to embed an image to finish the email.

There are ways to get the email to come directly into the inbox of your target, 
but unfortunately for us, they cost money.
This can be achieved through services like smtp2go.
After downloading and subscribing to their service, you can specify which IP and port you want 
the email server to use.  This is done with the -s <SERVER:PORT> option on the sendemail protocol.

There are a few way to tell that this malicious email didn't come from a trusted source:
-Google sends this message to the spam folder (first red flag)
-Google also includes a giant yellow box that says this isn't from a legitmate source, directly above the message body.
-If you click 'show original' in the options tab on the email, you can view the ARC-Authentication-Results 
-In the ARC-Authentication-Results you find a few key pieces of information...
--First there's the DKIM = <pass or fail> This lets you know if the header passed the authentication process.
---A DKIM pass indicates the email message has a DKIM signature and passed the mailbox provider's verification check
---A DKIM fail indicates the email message has a DKIM signature but there was an error causing a verification failure
--- Google states: DomainKeys Identified Mail is a protocol that allows an organization to take responsibility for
transmitting a message by signing it in a way that mailbox providers can verify.
---DKIM record verification is made possible through cryptographic authentication.
--Next is the SPF <pass or fail>   An SPF Validation error can occur when the Sender Policy Framework validation for a sender's domain does not succeed
---There are two different types of failures: hard fail and soft fail
----A hard fail means that emails from unauthorized senders are deleted only.  It will not make it to your spam folder or inbox.
----A soft fail means that mail can be allowed through but should be tagged as spam or suspicious.
--If you encounter a hard or soft fail under the SPF ARC Authentication Results, more than likely the email is not from the actual sender and is malicious.
--So to put it simply, think before you click...
