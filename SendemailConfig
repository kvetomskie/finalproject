After installing postfix and configuring it, it is time to install the sendemail program.
This is what we will use to send the actual fake email.
To install sendemail,
$ apt install sendemail

Now that you have the proper tools, it's time to start the mail server.
This is as simple as running 
$ systemctl start postfix

To confirm postfix is running, 
$ service postfix status

Next up is spoofing the from address and entering your target's email
